I was instructed by TA Charles to include a readme file which explains what my commits mean. Where it says Test Cases it is referring to U-Test. All the big commits are multiplayer functionality which involved a lot of lines of code and did not make sense committing in small code commits. The reroll testcases do fail sometimes this is not due to game logic rather due to the fact that it uses assertNotSame and sometimes when you reroll the you will get the same dice again.
